        <b>Your team values resonate with me.</b> When I read about the way you think and work, I consistently find myself nodding in agreement. I know you guys haven’t figured out everything, so do I. Let's do it together. <br><br>

        I find satisfaction in creating something that helps even one person. I can only imagine how rewarding it must be to <b>help millions of people</b> <br><br>

        I've made my research on your who you are and "googled" a lot of you. Especially Neal, Tuuli and Omar. Working with intelligent, dedicated colleagues sounds like a pretty great way to earn a living. I want to <b>work with people who care</b>. People who ask “why?”, and then shortly after, “How can we make this better?”. People with whom I share vision and values.

        Work in progress, TEXT TO REDO !!! <br><br><br>
        Advancing social progress is an ambiguous word. It can have a lot of meaning, my definition behind it is how we can move people toward the right direction, because we can also move them to the wrong direction. Technology now enable to reach millions of people from a single click bringing them together when they are not browsing for cats pictures. So my little idea is to use that reach and make content that will either make people reflect and think. And let a chain of positive ideas spread unconsciously. Some people argue that this won’t make a difference and I don’t know if it makes a difference. But that won’t keep me away from trying.

        In a more practical way. I would try to reach people with the most influent tool of today: Social media. Therefore the difficulty is to have people’s attention. In order to do that I would make content that interest them, bringing them values.

        Honestly I have no idea how to answer that question, but would love to hear your point of view.
