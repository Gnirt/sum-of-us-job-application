  <h2>Why are you applying for this job? (Suggested word limit: 125)</h2>
  <p class='answer-text'>
    I loved your job description, your cause and I was done when reading your values (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VftkSfLBYWT4iiowMyrSdDgCuL0MXLkbji5-4sVgz-o/edit). I know we are made to work together, you guys values match mine and a good book said: Look for cultural fit, over competence. (The book is tribal leadership, and my pinky tell me you read it. Or maybe it was good to great)

    and googled Neal, Tuuli and Omar

  <h2>What's one idea, big or small, that you have for how technology can be used to advance social progress? (Suggested word limit: 200)</h2>
  <p class='answer-text'>
  Advancing social progress is an ambiguous word. It can have a lot of meaning, my definition behind it is how we can move people toward the right direction, because we can also move them to the wrong direction. Technology now enable to reach millions of people from a single click bringing them together when they are not browsing for cats pictures. So my little idea is to use that reach and make content that will either make people reflect and think. And let a chain of positive ideas spread unconsciously. Some people argue that this won’t make a difference and I don’t know if it makes a difference. But that won’t keep me away from trying.

  In a more practical way. I would try to reach people with the most influent tool of today: Social media. Therefore the difficulty is to have people’s attention. In order to do that I would make content that interest them, bringing them values.

  Honestly I have no idea how to answer that question, but would love to hear your point of view.
